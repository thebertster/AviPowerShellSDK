# AviPowerShellSDK
PowerShell Module for Avi Networks API

This is a simple wrapper around the Avi Networks API to allow automation from PowerShell.

This is a work in progress and is not officially supported by Avi Networks!

Example Use:

Create a module folder named "AviSDK" in one of the default PowerShell module locations
(e.g. %userprofile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules).

Copy the AviSDK.psm1 and AviSDK.psd1 files into this module folder. This allows the module to be imported using:

Import-Module AviSDK

Example scripts can be found in the Examples directory.
